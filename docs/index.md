# LoveBug Documentation

Welcome to the LoveBug documentation! LoveBug is an agent-based model (ABM) of sexual selection and mating-preference co-evolution, built with Mesa-Frames and Polars for high-performance evolutionary simulations.

## What is LoveBug?

LoveBug simulates large populations (100k+ individuals) of digital "love-bugs" whose genomes encode display traits, mate preferences, and choosiness thresholds. Through genetic crossover, mutation, and optional cultural learning mechanisms, the model explores emergent evolutionary dynamics including:

- **Sexual selection**: Fisher-Lande-Kirkpatrick runaway processes
- **Assortative mating**: Preference-trait coevolution patterns
- **Cultural-genetic interactions**: Social learning effects on mate choice
- **Population genetics**: Drift vs. selection dynamics
- **Speciation processes**: Reproductive isolation emergence

### Basic Usage

```python
from lovebug import LoveModel, LayerActivationConfig

# Basic genetic-only simulation
model = LoveModel(population_size=5000)
model.run_model()

# With cultural learning layer
config = LayerActivationConfig(cultural_layer=True)
model = LoveModel(population_size=5000, layer_config=config)
model.run_model()

print(f"Final population: {len(model.agents)}")
```

## Model Architecture

### Genetic Layer (Core)

The foundational layer implements classical population genetics:

- **Genome structure**: 32-bit integers encoding display traits, preferences, and thresholds
- **Mate choice**: Hamming distance-based compatibility scoring
- **Reproduction**: Uniform crossover with per-bit mutation
- **Population dynamics**: Energy decay, aging, and density-dependent effects

### Cultural Layer (Optional)

Layer 2 adds social learning mechanisms:

- **Cultural transmission**: Non-genetic preference inheritance
- **Social networks**: Structured learning interactions
- **Cultural-genetic interactions**: Feedback between learning and evolution
- **Configurable algorithms**: Multiple social learning models

### Visualization System

Post-hoc analysis and visualization tools:

- **Publication quality**: Static figures for academic papers
- **Interactive exploration**: Dynamic parameter exploration
- **Multiple backends**: Matplotlib, Plotly, with extensions for animation
- **Academic integration**: Designed for research workflow compatibility

## Research Applications

LoveBug is particularly suited for investigating:

1. **Sexual selection theory**: Testing Fisher-Lande-Kirkpatrick predictions
2. **Cultural evolution**: Gene-culture coevolution in mate choice
3. **Population genetics**: Finite population effects on selection
4. **Comparative studies**: Cross-species evolutionary pattern analysis
5. **Educational applications**: Teaching evolutionary principles through simulation
